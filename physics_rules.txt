# Deduction Rules for Frontier Physics (HLRE methodology)

# Axiom 2: Constants are Structural Properties. Integers denote Degrees of Freedom.
# degree_of_freedom L N, inverse_coupling L C, N == C => explained_constant C L
# Simplified for the engine:
match_count(N, C) => is_equal(N, C)
degree_of_freedom(L, N), inverse_coupling(L, C), is_equal(N, C) => explained_constant(C, L)

# Axiom 3: Every property must be extrinsic. Mass as Lattice Resistance.
# lattice_structure L, particle P, lattice_resistance L P R => mass P R
lattice_structure(L, Name), particle(P, Name2), lattice_resistance(L, P, R) => mass(P, R)

# Axiom: Unity Requirement. Couplings near 1.0 denote Saturation.
# coupling_constant C V, V >= 1.0 => saturation_limit C V
is_saturated(V) => saturation_limit(C, V)

# Axiom 4: Particles as Topological Knots.
topology(T, Name), particle(P, Name2), knot_invariant(T, K) => particle_property(P, K)

# Mechanical Saturation leads to Structural Failure (Decay)
saturation_limit(C, V), particle(P, Name), dependent_on(P, C) => mechanical_failure(P, "Saturation")

# Fine Structure Constant as Lattice scattering channels
lattice_structure(L, "D4"), degree_of_freedom(L, "137") => inverse_coupling(L, "137")
is_equal("137", "137") => true("137") # placeholder
