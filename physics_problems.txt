Problem 1:
The Fine Structure Constant (alpha) is approximately 1/137. Using the HLRE methodology, deduce the mechanical properties of the vacuum lattice that would necessitate this specific integer value.

Problem 2:
The Top Quark has a mass of approximately 173 GeV and a Yukawa coupling near 1.0. Analyze this as a mechanical saturation point and predict the consequences for its stability.

Problem 3:
Map the concept of "Quark Flavor" to a Hyper-Literal mechanical description involving geometric phase and lattice topology.
